The location is very convenient. It's a five minute walk to the airport (so you really don't have to hire a cab to get to the house if you're coming by plane). You can take the Silver Line bus from the airport, which takes you to South Station, with a stop at the Convention Center. The ride to the city is free ! Those buses take off every 6-10 minutes or so. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>3. Despite being close to the airport, the house is very calm, and I didn't have any trouble sleeping -- and I'm *VERY* sensitive to noise, so it means that the place is indeed very calm. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>4. Responsive but not overbearing host. A pleasure dealing with.\n",

       "1     I live in the Back Bay and I'm happy to accommodate any unique requests. \\n\\nOur properties are available to business professionals seeking short-term corporate housing and families visiting Boston area hospitals.  Please inquire about our special rates for those associated with Shriners, MGH, BWH,  BIDMC, and Mass Eye and Ear. \\n\\nMy large family are all long-time Boston residents, and most of the members still own apartments from when they lived in downtown Boston.  All of my condo's are owned by members of my family.\\n\\nPrior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.\\n\\nIf you stay with us during the summer months (typically available mid weekdays from the middle of June to Labor Day), we'd love to take you out on our 50-ft yacht for a complimentary afternoon sail and lunch (catered by a restaurant / bar we own) around the Boston Harbor (schedule and availability permitting and limited to guests 16 years and older).\\n\\nAlso feel free to inquire about special rates on massages at Bodywaves - a business my father runs on Hanover St. in Boston's Quincy Market / Faneuil Hall area.   \n",

Founded in 2010, Thatch's goal is to make Boston more accessible by providing innovative housing and hotel concepts at prices and on terms that put the value in hospitality back where it belongs - with the guests. We do this by stripping out non-essential services and amenities - like daily room cleaning and on-site food and beverage - and by centralizing our staff. In exchange, Thatch guests are afforded privacy, independence and more room in their travel budgets. Simple. Flexible. Functional. That's Thatch.   \n",
