# Boston Airbnb Data Storage & Visulisation

Boston is the 4th most crowded cities in the United States. (Source: https://www.rent.com/blog/most-crowded-cities-in-america/) Finding a stay here can be pretty overwhelming. With many options available, one might want to know what is the best one. Though there are many hotels in and around, finding a homestay for both, short term or long term, can be challenging. Thanks to a well built airbnb network here, one has many options to chose from.

## Inspiration
I created this project to provide analytics of the airbnb network in Boston, showcasing well rated areas, top-rated listings, map visulisation of the airbnb with each listing's crucial information and top rated hosts.

## Approach
The goal was to create an end-to-end pipeline of data extraction, processing, storage and analytics. The tools used to achieve this were python (pandas, numpy, pscopg2, os), PostGreSQL and Tableau.
